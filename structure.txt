Client folder ==> Holds the client side code (react);

***anything outside the client belongs to the server***
route folder ==> Holds our routes
api ==> hosds the api routes

Model ==> this holds our database schema for mongoose

config ==> contains our server side configuration such as auth keys etc

Validator ==> holds our utility function used to handle data comming through api

Note: if your having issues understanding the sever structure,
concentrate on the client for now, dont worry it would all make
sence when we meet or as the we go further
